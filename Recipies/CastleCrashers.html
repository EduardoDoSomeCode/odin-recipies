<ul>   
<li>2 ¼ cup All-Purpose Flour</li>
<li>1 tsp Baking Soda</li>
<li>1 tsp Salt</li>
<li>1 cup Butter</li>
<li>¾ cup Granulated Sugar</li>
<li>¾ cup Brown Sugar</li>
<li>1 ½ tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
<li>2 Eggs</li>
<li>2 cups Chocolate Chips</li>
</ul>


<ol>
  <li>Pre-heat your oven to 375°F. I recommend that you get your butter to room temperature
 so it is easier to work with. To do that let it sit out for about a half hour before you are
 going to start working with it. Once you are ready to start baking, mash the butter until it 
appears smooth. I used a spoon at the point.</li>
  <li>Using a stand or hand mixer, combine the sugar with butter. 
add the vanilla extract and eggs. I recommend adding the eggs one at a time. 
Doing this helps combine them with everything else better.,</li>
  <li>In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. 
Start to slowly mix the flour into the butter mixture. I tend to do it in 3-4 batches to make 
sure the flour combines well with everything.</li>
<li>Stir in the chocolate chips. At this point use a spoon.
 You don’t want to destroy the chips with a stand or hand mixer.
Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with a non-stick spray. 
I take about a tablespoon of the dough and place it on the pan. 
Once you have the pan filled, place in the oven and bake for about 8-11 minutes or 
until golden brown. After you take the cookies out allow them to cool.</li>
